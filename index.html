            <p class="intro">Hi, I'm a student at The Bear Creek School going into my senior year. I love photography, graphic design, and programming, in school and as hobbies. Here's some of my best work.</p>

                    <a href="/photography/" class="ht">Photography</a>
                    <p>I love photography, especially landscape photography. It combines my love for hiking and digital arts, resulting in beautiful photos. I also like taking pictures of architecture and animals - for example, the red panda on the right. Photography helps us appreciate the beauty of the world around us like almost no other discipline can.</p>

                    <a href="/graphic-design/" class="ht">Graphic Design</a>
                    <p>I like graphic design because it lets me make design with no restraints - any idea can be made with just a few tools. It seems deceptively simple at first, but the true depth of what you can do with the pen tool is incredible, and I've only begun to scratch the surface.</p>

                    <p>There's nothing more satisfying than finally solving a problem you've been working at for a while, especially when the result is a useful or visually interesting project. I like computer science because it involves creative problem solving to reach an interesting result - such as the image filter seen on the right.</p>
